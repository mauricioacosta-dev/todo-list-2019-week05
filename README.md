# âœ… Awesome: Todo List

![item list]()

### Tech Used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
Here I have a completely responsive Todo List. This Todo list allows user to input task/items that they want to complete.  They will then be able to cross completed items of.  They than can chooses to clear the completed items and then clear the complete list. 



Example:
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
```
